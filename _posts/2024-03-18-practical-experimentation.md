## First post, breaking ground

Data science, tech development in genral, it's about curiosity. This repo won't just be meandering through the concept of learning new tools, or quick tech demos. Hopefully. My interests fall on the intersection of technology and art, and jumping into the deep end to see what'll stick to the wall. It'll aim to be an ode to the hands-on, gritty, often frustrating journey of practical experimentation. I'll share mistakes, fuckups, hopefully you can relate. It's where I tend to learn the most. But if I do make something cool, something unexpected, it'll be here too. 


## The reward, the process

LLM's, data science and AI in general, algorithmic and AI art generation right now in particular read like a wild, untamed beast, and it's fascinating. Weâ€™re not just creating images or designs or text prediction models; we're becoming co-conspirators with algorithms in the act of creation and development as they stomp through the bramble. The process is not always sleek. It's messy. People have become polarized quickly, but it's a concept we're all confronting on the daily. I'm not planning to tackle any of that too seriously in this blog, but won't be hesitating to poke at the ideas if they come up either.
